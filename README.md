# autoDLD
A ruby script that generates verilog code, circuit diagram, and kmap for any given non-trivial boolean function with input size less than 10.

## Usage:
Copy the file autoDLD.rb and run it. You will need to have the necessary dependencies. If you are using OS X, there is a guide in the beginning of the script written in comment. Upon running the script, you will be prompted to name the to-be-generated files, the number of bits as input of function, and values that evaluates to 1 in the concerned boolean function.
